<h1>Learning PHP with creating web for virtual Cafe</h1>
<p>I had to make some basic CRUD operations in PHP so i decided to make login and register panel also with admin panel when admin logs in.</p>
<p>It was my first experience with PHP and also with object oriented programming in this language...</p>
<p>In this project i learned how to make basic database in PHPMyAdmin, CRUD operations over database and the most important part âœ¨ connecting database to my code âœ¨.</p>
<p>Enjoy! ðŸª„</p>
